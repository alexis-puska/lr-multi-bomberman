1. INTRODUCTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is an FAQ that focuses on items in Super Bomberman 3. It details the
location of the items in the normal game and the items that are available in 
battle mode as well as descriptions of the various items in the game.

I have no idea why I have written this guide. I guess it's because I didn't see
any guide for Super Bomberman 3 like it. I hope it's of some use to you.

2. Version History
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.1: - Started on 10 September 2004.
v1: - First draft completed 13 September 2004.

3. Item Descriptions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These are my thoughts of the items in the game. 
(N): - Available in normal game.
(B): - Available in battle mode.
(X): - You lose these items when you're killed.

Flame (N), (B): Adds extra range to your bombs blast. Each one will increase 
the range of your bombs blast by an extra ground square. The more you have 
the more effective your bombs will be. You can have a maximum of 6 Flames. 
That'll give you a blast range of 8 squares.

Bomb (N), (B): Allows you to plant an extra bomb. It'll make you capable of 
setting off chain reactions that can easily take out opponents and enemies. 
The more you have the more effective the Brown Louie will be. The maximum 
number of bombs you can have is 8. That gives you 9 bombs.

Skate (N), (B): Increases the speed of Bomberman. More speed makes it 
easier to get yourself out of danger and allows you to quickly nip in and trap 
opponents and enemies when they're vulnerable. A word of warning, the faster 
you get the more sensitive the controller is to your movements. This can lead 
to you being so fast that you get into trouble. Just be sure you can handle 
more speed before you collect the skate. You can have a maximum of 9 skates 
each one making you faster. 

Clog (N): It'll decrease your speed by a level. It's the opposite of a Skate. 
DO NOT PICK UP. Make sure you blow these up, as you don't want to 
be slower. They are pretty rare though.

Egg (N), (B): Stepping over these gives you a Louie (See Section 4. Louie 
Types). If you have one Louie then stepping on an egg will have no effect.

P-Bomb (N), (B), (X): This will give your first bomb maximum blast range of 8
ground squares. Quite useful in the Battle mode.

Remote Bomb (N), (X): Allows you to detonate your bombs by pressing B. 
This is the best item in the game. You must get this item to survive in the 
normal game. Pity that it's not in the battle mode but I guess it would make 
it a bit unfair. It lets you easily eliminate the enemies. Just make sure 
you're not in the way of the bomb blast when you detonate it. If you pick up 
another bomb like the slime, spike or P-bomb then you'll lose your remote 
bombs so be careful. It'll also make bosses much easier to defeat.

Slime Bomb (N), (B), (X): If you throw these bombs they'll bounce all over the 
place. If you kick then they'll bounce back and forth till the blow up. These 
bombs are very unpredictable and not suited to the normal game but in battle 
they can be effective and a lot of fun. You can easily kill yourself with these
bombs.

Spike Bomb (N), (X): When these bombs detonate the blast will pass though all 
soft blocks. It makes it very effective at killing enemies and taking out all 
the blocks quickly. Unfortunately they are first available in the same level as
the remote bombs so you may never really get a chance to use them despite 
their usefulness.

Kick (N), (B), (X): If you press yourself against a bomb with the kick the bomb
will slide until it hits an obstacle or you press the X button. It can be 
useful for trapping enemies and opponents if used effectively.

Glove (N), (B), (X): When you lay a bomb you can press A to pick it up and 
by releasing A you will throw the bomb over blocks. When used correctly you 
can take out opponents in battle mode with ease. It's useful in the normal game
too. It an opponent throws a bomb at you and hits you with it you will be 
stunned but if you were holing a bomb at the same time then the bomb will 
bounce off you. Offence and defence in one item. The blue Louie has an ability 
much like this.

Heart (N), (X): Allows you to take an extra hit from an enemy/blast. You can 
only have one of these and getting more has no effect. I hoped that you could 
collect 9 of these and have 9 extra hits but no luck. You can get one in battle
mode if you win soccer bomber mini game. 

1-up (N): Adds an extra life to you. You can have a maximum of 9 lives in the 
game.

Bombpass (N), (X): It allows you to pass though your own bombs. Very useful
and it stops you from stupidly trapping yourself. If you have a kick then this
will override it and you'll not be abler to kick bombs and vice-versa with the
kick overriding the Bombpass. IMO Bombpass is more useful than the kick for 
the normal game.

Blockpass (N), (X): A must have item that allows you to pass through soft 
blocks. It allows you to take out enemies that can't get to you and it'll help
you out of a tricky situation. IMO it's necessary for the final stage.

Ice Cream (N): Adds 1000 points to your score.

Apple (N): Adds 200 points to your score.

Clock (N):  It stops the time and enemies for 16 seconds. It's extremely rare 
but very useful. You can kill a few enemies with ease.

Bombvest (N): Makes you invincible for 16 seconds. Make good use of those 
16 seconds. Quite a rare item.

Gold Flame (B): Gives you maximum rage instantly. A handy item only available
in battle mode.

Skull (B): This is a special battle item that has various effects. It can 
produce some funny effects if you're playing a multiplayer game with some 
friends. Some of the effects are actually quite useful where as others are 
bad for you. 
You can get rid of the skull by collecting an item or by passing it onto 
another opponent by touching them. The skull can't be destroyed; instead it'll
bounce to another square when hit by a bomb blast. There are 8 different 
effects:

Speed Boost: Gives you maximum speed, the equivalent of 9 Skates. A useful 
effect. 

Speed Down: Gives you the equivalent of the clogs. It makes you super slow 
and easy pickings for opponents. Get rid of it quick or your dead. Passing it 
onto an opponent can be hilarious. 

Cant Stop: Bomberman slides till he hits an obstacle when he's moved. Not as 
bad as it sounds if you know how to control it. 
Then again it's not exactly desirable. 

Quick Detonation: Your bombs will take less time to detonate. This can 
Actually be a good thing if you're fast enough. It can make opponents run in 
fear of your bombs.

Slow Detonation: Your bombs will take longer to detonate. This is a bad effect.
You'll be waiting ages to blow something or someone up. Still if you trap an 
opponent then there's an agonising wait for them to die and that can be fun. 

Sets Bombs Uncontrollably: Where you walk bombs will follow you. If you've 
only got a few bombs then it's not too bad but if you've got 6 bombs then 
you've a challenge not to kill yourself. Your opponents will run the hell away
from you when you've got this. Pass it on to one of then for some laughs.

Minimum Range Bombs: Gives your bombs the range of one of the squares. 
Really bad!!! Lose this item quickly or you'll be laughed at for ages.

Can't Plant Bomb: Your unable to plant any bombs with this effect. A horrible 
effect that means you have to run for your life. A nice one to give to a 
friend though.

Reverse Control: This effect reverses your control of Bomberman. It's a 
nightmare to control when you have to push left to go right. 

Teleport: It switches you and an opponent about. It can be good or bad 
depending on the circumstances. A very unpredictable effect.

4. Louie Types
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you step over an egg you get a little creature that kinda resembles a 
Kangaroo. The animal will be with you till you take a hit from a bomb or an 
enemy. Note that you lose the ability to use your glove when on a Louie. Each 
colour of the Louie has a different ability that can use used by pressing the 
Y button on the control pad.

Yellow Louie: - He can kick the soft blocks in a straight line. He's excellent 
for battle mode as you can easily trap your opponents but in the normal game 
he is useless. Only good for taking a hit.

Green Louie: - He has a super speed burst ability. It sounds good but it's not.
He'll run in a straight-line only stopping when he hits an object. If you've 
got the Blockpass item he'll only stop when he hits the border of the area. 
This often means that you run into an enemy. Not a very good Louie to have 
but he can take a hit for you so he's not completely useless and I suppose he 
may save you on the odd occasion if used well.

Blue Louie: - He can kick bombs over the blocks. Essentially he's the Louie 
equivalent of a Glove. Very useful if you don't have a Glove but not too 
great if you have one. He's decent to get in an early level before the 
Glove is available.

Brown Louie: - He will lay a line of bombs equivalent of the number of bombs 
you currently have. If you have 9 bombs this guy will rule. As long as you know
how to use him and don't stupidly blow yourself up this guy will be your best 
asset against the bosses. I highly recommend getting this Louie. 

Pink Louie: - He can jump over one block. This guy is useful and can easily 
get you out of a tight situation especially on the ice levels. If you have the 
Blockpass item his value is limited but he is one of the better Louie's.

6. Item Locations (Battle Mode)

section of the game. I do not have the exact number of items but I do have the 
types of items available in each stage.

1 - Block Buster: Kick, Skate, Flame, Bomb, Egg, Skull.

one of the following items: Bomb, Skate, Glove, Heart, Kick, Clog.
Getting the heart is the preferable option. 

If you can, follow the item you want with your eyes. It's not too hard to do.

7. General Tips
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Remember that you can revisit any level if you didn't get any items you need. 

Once you have killed the boss on stage 5 you cannot return to any previous 
level and you go straight to stage 6. Make sure you have the items you need. 

The chances of living in stage 6 with your starting gear are slim. Therefore I 
recommend not using the password 6363. Instead use 2301. You can collect 
any items you need and then you can defeat the stage 5 boss and enter stage 6 
fully equipped.

I recommend visiting 1.1, 1.4, 3.3, 3.2, 1.1, 1.1, 1.1, 1.1, then the stage 5 
boss. With this you will have the best items for your survival. 
I recommend visiting 1.1 often just for extra Skates. 
You'll need to be fast in stage 6. 

I recommend the following items for stage 6: - Bomb x8, Flame x6, Skate x6 
(You can have more in necessary), Brown Louie, Remote Bomb, Glove, 
Bombpass, Blockpass, Heart. Remote bombs and Blockpass are essential. 
You'll need to be very skilled to survive without those two items. With the 
items mentioned above you should be able to win the game as long as you don't 
die and lose your Remote Bombs and Blockpass.
